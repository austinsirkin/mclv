# Project Title

I call this "MC List Viewer 2.0", which is a good description of what it does. It's the second version, redesigned from the ground up using the Slim framework and Twig templates.

## Getting Started

To run this app on your own machine, you'll need to ensure that you're running PHP 5.6 or higher, and that your system has all of the proper permissions to send API calls. Generally speaking, a WAMP/LAMP/XAMPP server should suffice.

### Installing

To install, just copy the file structure to your server, but make sure your base directory for the files is /mclv.

## Built With

I used a combination of Notepad, Notepad++, Slim, Twig, Composer, and maybe a few other bits and pieces from here and there. Not to mention my earlier MC List Viewer 1.0.
